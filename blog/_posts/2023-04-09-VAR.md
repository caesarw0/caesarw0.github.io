Risk management is crucial in portfolio optimization when talking about investment. Knowing how much risk we can tolerate, we can make informed investment decisions. Value-at-risk (VAR) is one of the most widely used measures of risk and has become a standard measure of risk used by banks and other financial institutions around the world. In fact, VAR ([RiskMetrics](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041615/what-riskmetrics-value-risk-var.asp)) was launched within JP Morgan prior to 1994. Investment banks like [Goldman Sachs used VAR](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/magazine/04risk-t.html) and other risk models, to mitigate the impact of the market downturn and to limit their losses during the 2008 financial crisis.

In this blog, we will explore the concept of VAR and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) in detail and demonstrate how they can be used to calculate risk in financial portfolios. Topics involve the basics of VAR, how to calculate it using different methods (historical, parametric, and simulation), and how to interpret the results. After reading this blog, you'll have a solid understanding of VAR and its implementation and importance in risk management.
