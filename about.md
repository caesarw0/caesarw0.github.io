## Hi there👋

![icon_2](/assets/img/icon_2.jpg)
{:.about_avatar}

My name is Caesar, and I am currently pursuing a Masters of Data Science degree at [UBC](https://ubc.ca).
I have always been passionate about data science and software engineering, and
I've had the opportunity to work in several exciting roles where I have been able to build on my skills and experience.

### Previous Experience

Before beginning my studies at UBC, I had the privilege of working as a software engineer at [Societe Generale](https://www.societegenerale.com/en). It was there that I was able to focus on some exciting projects, including cutting-edge software in document parsing using deep learning, OCR, and NER. I was able to conduct several proof-of-concept initiatives and develop a prototype that reduced human effort in digitization by 70%. Additionally, I also had the opportunity to design and develop PowerBI dashboards to help the compliance team monitor communication data more efficiently.

Prior to my role at Societe Generale, I joined [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/) after completing my undergraduate studies in Computer Science. As a technical consultant, I helped my clients build machine learning pipelines and deploy ML models using MLOps, Airflow, and AWS EC2. I gained invaluable experience working with data scientists and learned about industrial ML practices, which allowed me to stay at the forefront of the field.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research assistant on a project focused on malware detection using machine learning, and I also wrote my final year thesis on Wi-Fi connection data. Working with large datasets and cloud-based platforms allowed me to gain hands-on experience that truly sparked my passion for data science.

### Future Direction

With all of this experience under my belt, I decided to pursue a Masters of Data Science degree to deepen my knowledge and gain more insights into the field. I am set to graduate in June 2023 and am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.

My experiences have shown me the power of data-driven decision making, inspiring me to pursue a career in the field.
With a Masters of Data Science degree almost completed, I am excited to bring my skills and expertise to new opportunities.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope that you find my work informative and inspiring!
