We are delighted to announce that our team has won the Judge's award and Best Team Goals Presentation in the
[Hack The Threat 23 Hackathon Competition](https://hackhpc.github.io/HacktheThreat23/)
organized by [Simon Fraser University]((https://www.sfu.ca/big-data.html)), [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), and [HackHPC.org](http://hackhpc.org/). This is an incredible achievement that has been made possible by the collaboration and hard work of our team.

At the BOLT McGill business case competition, our team was challenged to design a solution that uses digital technologies to transform the shopping experience across all customer touchpoints. We selected the grocery industry as our focus and developed an innovative solution that benefits both customers and grocery businesses.

Our solution leverages digital technologies to offer a personalized and convenient shopping experience. With our solution, customers can easily find the products they need, make informed purchasing decisions, and enjoy personalized recommendations. Grocery businesses can also benefit from increased customer loyalty, and gain insights from the collected data.

If you are interested in learning more about our solution or supporting our mission to revolutionize the grocery industry, we invite you to explore this webpage and reach out to us.
Our team is always open to new opportunities and partnerships that can help us further develop and bring our solution to life.

## Problem-Solution

Our team understands the inconveniences and frustrations that come with in-person grocery shopping:

- Too many options
- Long lines
- Lack of personalized recommendations

That's why we developed Smart Grocery - A solution that enhances the shopping experience and helps customers save time.

Our solution offers the shortest route to the grocery store or a combination of stores with all the products on your list, making your shopping trip more efficient and effective. Our application can sort out the most efficient shopping route by just inputting the grocery list.

We've also integrated indoor localization technology to improve your in-store experience. You'll be able to locate yourself in the store and receive navigation to the items you want.

Lastly, the solution also includes a personalized shopping list that is tailored to your healthy diet and prompt suitable promotions from our grocery partners. Making the experience more unique and personalized.

Eventually, our goal is to help customers extract more value from their grocery shopping experience. We believe that Smart Grocery has the potential to revolutionize the way people shop for groceries and we are committed to making it a reality.
